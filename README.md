# Transformerless-Power-Supply---KiCAD
This project involves designing a simple transformerless power supply using KiCAD. The circuit takes standard AC mains input (e.g., 120V/230V) and provides a low-voltage DC output suitable for powering small electronic circuits.  Instead of a bulky transformer, the design uses a capacitive dropper circuit, using capacitors, zener diodes, ect.
